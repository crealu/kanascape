# Kanascape

Kanascape offers an interface for users to interact with 
the kana alphabets of the Japanese langauge - hiragana and katakana.
By selecting individual kana, users can construct queries,
ping an external API and return specific data related to the criteria.

In addition to specific words, users can view particular kanji
who use the readings of the kana in an expandable view format.

Filtering based on the exact reading of the query or the combination
of sounds in query can also be done.

This is a microfrontend feature of Niheigo.
